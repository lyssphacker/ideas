### Computing is in a real trouble

#### Gerry Sussman, [Computer Science is in deep trouble](http://worrydream.com/refs/Sussman%20-%20Robust%20Design%20through%20Diversity.pdf)  
Computer Science is in deep trouble. Structured design is a
failure. Systems, as currently engineered, are brittle and fragile.
They cannot be easily adapted to new situations. Small changes in
requirements entail large changes in the structure and configuration.
Small errors in the programs that prescribe the behavior of the system
can lead to large errors in the desired behavior. Indeed, current
computational systems are unreasonably dependent on the correctness of
the implementation, and they cannot be easily modified to account for
errors in the design, errors in the specifications, or the inevitable
evolution of the requirements for which the design was commissioned.
(Just imagine what happens if you cut a random wire in your computer!)
This problem is structural. This is not a complexity problem. It
will not be solved by some form of modularity. We need new ideas. We
need a new set of engineering principles that can be applied to
effectively build flexible, robust, evolvable, and efficient systems.

#### Gerry Sussman, [We Really Don't Know How to Compute!](https://github.com/lyssphacker/talks/blob/master/we-really-do-not-know-how-to-compute/we-really-do-not-know-how-to-compute.md)  
We are in a real trouble and have not the foggiest idea how to compute very well. There might be some glimmer of hope on the horizon, in number of different directions, some of which I might point out.

#### Alan Kay, [The Present Does Not Compute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp9VbtLn2Jw&t=16m1s)
We are in the situation where the hardware capacity allows a lot of stuff that does not scale very well to barely survive, but survives at the expense of being able to improve it, make changes, understand it, etc.

#### Gerry Sussman, [Computer science actively discourages the construction of robust systems](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/robust-systems.pdf)
Observations of biological systems tell us a great deal about
how to make robust and evolvable systems. Techniques originally
developed in support of symbolic Artificial Intelligence can
be viewed as ways of enhancing robustness and evolvability in
programs and other engineered systems. By contrast, common
practice of computer science actively discourages the construction
of robust systems.

#### Alan Kay, [Most code looks like a garbage dump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp9VbtLn2Jw&t=7m40s)
Code is not organized nearly as nicely as a book. It looks more like garbage dump. It is the kind of thing that would be condemned if anybody could ever look at it, but if you look at garbage dump through a window about this big, it only looks slightly messy. If you could look at the entire garbage dump I think we would be horrified. It is not really a dump, because people have to live with this. So perhaps, this is a city after a great disaster where people are still forced to live.

#### Alan Kay, [Software has fallen short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp9VbtLn2Jw)
(paraphrasing) If the computing does not reach higher qualitative bar in the next 10 years ... it will just be gone, and what we'll have is enormous ad-hoc mechanisms, in one of the longest, slowest crashes in history.

#### Alan Kay, [Software is slum-like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QboI_1WJUlM&t=17m44s)
Picture that fits our code is a slum, particularly the web, but basically it is all rather slum-like. There is no large sense of architecture of any kind, things are tacked in there, urban renewal bulldozes some stuff out, but just leaves some stuff lying around.

#### Alan Kay, [Is “Software Engineering” an Oxymoron?](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6c8d/f2c143c93290bcaa8338992a14aa7ac3369a.pdf)
If software does “engineering” at all, it is too often at the same level as the
ancient Egyptians before the invention of the arch (literally before the making of arches: architecture), who made
large structures with hundreds of thousands of slaves toiling for decades to pile stone upon stone: they used weak
ideas and weak tools, pretty much like most software development today.

#### Alan Kay, [Computing is a pop culture](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523)
You could think of it as putting a low-pass filter on some of the good ideas from the ’60s and ’70s, as computing spread out much, much faster than educating unsophisticated people can happen. In the last 25 years or so, we actually got something like a pop culture, similar to what happened when television came on the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting Shakespeare to the masses. But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more perspective to understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as they were.

So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture.

#### Alan Kay, [The Web - one of the worst things ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9c7_8Gp7gI&t=28m30s)
The Web - I will not go into my diatribe about the web, but the web browser is one of the worst things ever. It only does a few things compared to what it should be doing. This is hard to explain to people. It is hard to find people who are willing to criticize the web.

#### Alan Kay, [GNU/Linux - budget of bad ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmsIZUuBoQs)
... learning Linux. It has thousands and thousands of commands. You can spend your entire life just ticking around with Linux and never learn anything about computing. It has the illusion of being something important about computing, but in fact it is kind of a budget of bad ideas.

#### Alan Kay, [Computing is getting more and more mundane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e8VZlPBx_0&t=54m58s)
As computing gets less and less interesting, it's way of accepting and rejecting things gets more and more mundane. This why some of these early systems ... Sam [Altman] looked at Sketchpad and asked: "Why aren't they doing it today?". Well, because nobody even thinks that this is important. Nobody even thinks of doing WYSIWYG on Web media. I just typed in some answers to Quora, and I was in the regime that was pre-70s. I was typing into a little window, I could not see how it was gonna look like until I clicked the button ... come on, this is bullshit. But nobody is protesting except old fogies like me because I know it can be better, you need to find out that it can be better.

#### Alan Kay, [Personal computing became a vast narcissistic mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHr4wAiXQD4&t=6m45s)
That by and large is what happened to personal computing since it came out commerically in early 80s. It basically became vast narcissistic mirror for the largest proportion of users, worse than almost any kind of thing we could have invented. We invented a new way for people to admire themselves and ignore almost anything of consequence.

#### Marvin Minsky, [AI has been brain dead since the 1970s](https://www.wired.com/2003/08/why-a-i-is-brain-dead/)
If AI's brain-dead, aren't you partially to blame?
No. I've been continually working on the problem. I'm trying to put a new project together, but it's hard to get 10 capable people. It would take five or ten years, and nobody wants to put that kind of time in - people want to double their money overnight.

#### Alan Kay, [iPad UI is very poor in a myriad of ways](http://techland.time.com/2013/04/02/an-interview-with-computing-pioneer-alan-kay/)
There is the desire of a consumer society to have no learning curves. This tends to result in very dumbed-down products that are easy to get started on, but are generally worthless and/or debilitating. We can contrast this with technologies that do have learning curves, but pay off well and allow users to become experts (for example, musical instruments, writing, bicycles, etc. and to a lesser extent automobiles).

#### Alan Kay, [Complications are 100-1000s of times larger than complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubaX1Smg6pY&t=6m44s)
There are 2 terms here. Complications, sometimes called accidental complexity, people trying to make it look better. Actually a lot of complications we put into code is not really that accidental, it comes from bad process. Complexity is some intrinsic measure of what the meaning of the code is. It is really hard to define ... We would like complications to be very close to the intrinsic complexity, and what we've got where the amount of complications can be hunderd, maybe thousands of times more.
