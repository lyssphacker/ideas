### Collection of quotes which suggest that computing is generally in a real trouble

#### Gerry Sussman, [Robust Design through Diversity](http://worrydream.com/refs/Sussman%20-%20Robust%20Design%20through%20Diversity.pdf)  
Computer Science is in deep trouble. Structured design is a
failure. Systems, as currently engineered, are brittle and fragile.
They cannot be easily adapted to new situations. Small changes in
requirements entail large changes in the structure and configuration.
Small errors in the programs that prescribe the behavior of the system
can lead to large errors in the desired behavior. Indeed, current
computational systems are unreasonably dependent on the correctness of
the implementation, and they cannot be easily modified to account for
errors in the design, errors in the specifications, or the inevitable
evolution of the requirements for which the design was commissioned.
(Just imagine what happens if you cut a random wire in your computer!)
This problem is structural. This is not a complexity problem. It
will not be solved by some form of modularity. We need new ideas. We
need a new set of engineering principles that can be applied to
effectively build flexible, robust, evolvable, and efficient systems.

#### Gerry Sussman, [We Really Don't Know How to Compute!](https://github.com/lyssphacker/talks/blob/master/we-really-do-not-know-how-to-compute/we-really-do-not-know-how-to-compute.md)  
We are in a real trouble and have not the foggiest idea how to compute very well. There might be some glimmer of hope on the horizon, in number of different directions, some of which I might point out.

#### Alan Kay, [The Present Does Not Compute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp9VbtLn2Jw&t=16m1s)
We are in the situation where the hardware capacity allows a lot of stuff that does not scale very well to barely survive, but survives at the expense of being able to improve it, make changes, understand it, etc.

#### Gerry Sussman, [Computer science actively discourages the construction of robust systems](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/robust-systems.pdf)
Observations of biological systems tell us a great deal about
how to make robust and evolvable systems. Techniques originally
developed in support of symbolic Artificial Intelligence can
be viewed as ways of enhancing robustness and evolvability in
programs and other engineered systems. By contrast, common
practice of computer science actively discourages the construction
of robust systems.

#### Alan Kay, [Most code looks like a garbage dump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp9VbtLn2Jw&t=7m40s)
Code is not organized nearly as nicely as a book. It looks more like garbage dump. It is he kind of thing that would be condemned if anybody could ever look at it, but if you look at garbage dump through a window about this big, it only looks slightly messy. If you could look at the entire garbage dump I think we would be horrified. It is not really a dump, because people have to live with this. So perhaps, this is a city after a great disaster where people are still forced to live.

#### Alan Kay, [Software has fallen short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp9VbtLn2Jw)
(paraphrasing) If the computing does not reach higher qualitative bar in the next 10 years ... it will just be gone, and what we'll have is enormous ad-hoc mechanisms, in one of the longest, slowest crashes in history.

#### Alan Kay, [Software is slum-like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QboI_1WJUlM&t=17m44s)
Picture that fits our code is a slum, particularly the web, but basically it is all rather slum-like. There is no large sense of architecture of any kind, things are tacked in there, urban renewal bulldozes some stuff out, but just leaves the stuff lying around.
