The original Smalltalk did not use kind of procedure call ... it really acted as you were on a network. ... When you run Smalltalk over a network people make connection to the network by having what are called phantom objects. Phantom object is a stand-in for the object you are sending message to ... cause you are always sending a message to something. .. [Further explanation is done whith [this](slides/sending-object.png) slide] ... Suppose you are here and you think you are sending a message from object A to object B. They are maybe on different machines, so what is maybe really going on is object A is sending to a version of object B which is really going over a network to real B. These are called phantom objects. There is usually one class of them, and whenever you are distributing computation, usually the environment for objects of few local objects and the rest of them are phantom objects. Phantom objects take care of all of the network stuff and synchronizations, and reorderings and other kinds of things you have to do when you are going to slower media. That is well established technique, and in any good object-oriented language you can set that up literary in an afternoon. It is quite instructive to think about what it means not to send just a message but to send an object from one place to another. What parts of it's environment we have to bring along with it in order for it to be understood? In theory, sending an object (say we send object C across) ... C might not be well understood on the other side. On the other hand, it is still active, so if your network has the rule, as ours did at PARC, that whenever an object shows up and it's class is not there, the clone of it's class gets sucked over with it. Compare that to sending a data structure, which is sending bits, and how fragile they are, because you are not sure there are procedures on the other end to know them. Here you are ensuring that either nothing at all happens or right procedures are automatically sent along. That is exactly how Air training command protected their tapes [reference to the story from the beginning of the presentation]. You just ensure that procedures goes along with them. And it is quite easy, using these phantom objects to make that automatic. So you can think of the network objects as constantly rebalancing themselves as to where the code actually is.
