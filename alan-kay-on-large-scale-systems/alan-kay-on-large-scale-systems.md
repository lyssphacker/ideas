The original Smalltalk did not use kind of procedure call ... it really acted as you were on a network. ... When you run Smalltalk over a network people make connection to the network by having what are called phantom objects. Phantom object is a stand-in for the object you are sending message to ... cause you are always sending a message to something. .. [Further explanation is done whith [this](slides/sending-object.png) slide] ... Suppose you are here and you think you are sending a message from object A to object B. They are maybe on different machines, so what is maybe really going on is object A is sending to a version of object B which is really going over a network to real B. These are called phantom objects. There is usually one class of them, and whenever you are distributing computation, usually the environment for objects of few local objects and the rest of them are phantom objects. Phantom objects take care of all of the network stuff and synchronizations, and reorderings and other kinds of things you have to do when you are going to slower media. That is well established technique, and in any good object-oriented language you can set that up literary in an afternoon. It is quite instructive to think about what it means not to send just a message but to send an object from one place to another. What parts of it's environment we have to bring along with it in order for it to be understood? In theory, sending an object (say we send object C across) ... C might not be well understood on the other side. On the other hand, it is still active, so if your network has the rule, as ours did at PARC, that whenever an object shows up and it's class is not there, the clone of it's class gets sucked over with it. Compare that to sending a data structure, which is sending bits, and how fragile they are, because you are not sure there are procedures on the other end to know them. Here you are ensuring that either nothing at all happens or right procedures are automatically sent along. That is exactly how Air training command protected their tapes [reference to the story from the beginning of the presentation]. You just ensure that procedures goes along with them. And it is quite easy, using these phantom objects to make that automatic. So you can think of the network objects as constantly rebalancing themselves as to where the code actually is.

This is the earliest known form of what we call data abstraction. It goes all the way back to pre '61. I was in the air force in 1961 and I saw it then. It probably goes back one year before. Back then they did not really have operating systems. Air training command had to send tapes of many kinds of records around from air force base to air force base. There was a question how could you deal with all these that used to be card images, and then because tape had come in there are starting to be more and more complicated formats. And somebody, almost cerainly an enlisted man, because officers did not program back then, came up with the following [idea](slides/b220.png). This person said, on the third part of the record on this tape we will put all the records of this particular type. On the second part we will put all the procedures that know how to deal with the formats on this third part of the tape. And on the first part we are going to put pointers into the procedures and lets make first 10 or so pointers standard, like reading and writing fields, trying to print, lets have standard vocabulary for the first 10 of these and then we can have idiosyncratic ones later on. So all you have to do read a tape back in 1961 is to read the front part of the record in core storage and start jumping indirect throught the pointers and the procedures were there. Now, I would really like you to contrast that with what you have to do with HTML on the Internet. Think about it. HTML on the Internet has gone back to the dark ages because it presupposes that there should be a browser that should understand it's formats. That has to be one of the worse ideas since MS-DOS. This is really a shame. This is maybe what happens when physicists decide to play with computers, I am not sure. And in fact, we can see what has happened to the Internet now. There are 2 wars going on. There is set of browser wars which are 100% irrelevant. They are basically an attempt either at demonstrating a non-understanding of how to build complex systems, or even cruder attmept simply to gather teritory. I suspect Microsoft is in the latter camp here. You do not need a browser if you followed what this staff sergant in the Air Force knew how to do in 1961. You just read it in, it should travel with all the things it needs, and you do not need anything more complex than something like X-Windows, hopefully better. But, basically you want to be able to distribute all of the knowledge of these things that are there. And in fact the Internet is starting to move in that direction as people discover ever more complex HTML formats ever more intractable. This one of these mistakes that has been recapitulated every generation, and it is just simply not the way to do it. So, here it is a great idea. BTW, this kind of programming was done before there were higher level languages in the Air Force, and this approach to things was forced out of the Air Force by Cobol, when the standardized on Cobol.
