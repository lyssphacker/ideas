[Aspect-Oriented Programming](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/papers/kiczales-ECOOP1997-AOP.pdf)  

Questions:  
1. Can AOP be neatly combined with well established styles of programming, OOP and FP? Are there some examples of that combination?  
2. Was work on AOP influenced by work on Meta-Object protocols?
