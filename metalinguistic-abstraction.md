#### Metalinguistic abstraction is the key for building robust systems ####

Gerry Sussman, [Lecture 3B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X21cKVtGvYk): In order to make a system that is robust, it has to be insensitive to small changes, i.e. small change in the problem should lead only to the small change in the solution. There ought to be a continuity - the space of solutions out to be continous in the space of problems. The way to do that was instead of solving a particular problem at every level of decomposition of the problem into subproblems, what you solve is a class of problems which are in the neighbourhood of the particular problem you are trying to solve. The you do that is by producing a language at level of detail, in which the solutions to that class of problems is representable in that language. Therefore, when you make small changes to the problem you are trying to solve, you generally have to make only small changes to the solution you constructed because at the level of detail you are working there is a language where you can express various solutions to alternate problems of the same type.
