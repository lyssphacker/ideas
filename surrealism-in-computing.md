In computing often it is not clear whether something is a joke or a serious thing, artistic expression which reminds of a surrealism, or something done in full seriousness.  

Manifestations of that kind:  
1. Jenkins
2. Object-relation mapping
3. Web
4. Decades old CPU architectures
5. Languages without syntactic abstraction 
6. UNIX-like OSes

More realistic alternatives:
1. lambdacd
2. Datomic, object-oriented dbs (Statice)
3. Hypercard on the Internet
4. Software dictates HW, not the other way around
5. Let's not be syntax freaks. Code is data, simplify syntax.
6. Object-oriented OSes (Genera)
