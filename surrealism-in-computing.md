In computing often it is not clear whether something is a joke or a serious thing, artistic expression which reminds of a surrealism, or something done in full seriousness.

1. Jenkins
2. Object-relation mapping
3. Web
4. Decades old CPU architectures
5. Languages without syntactic abstraction 
6. UNIX-like OSes
