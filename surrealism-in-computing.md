In computing often it is not clear whether something is a joke or a serious thing, artistic expression which reminds of a surrealism, or something done in full seriousness.  

Manifestations of that kind:  
1. Jenkins - tweaking complex pipelines via **Web** UI is cool
2. Object-relational mapping - updating data in place is cool (live in the present, how cares about the past ... or the future)
3. Web - sending text files around is cool (interpretation is up to you), the most important thing is that we **understand** each other
4. Decades old CPU architectures - our sw is slow because we have a lot of features
5. Languages without syntactic abstraction - we need a little bit of tyranny in this golden age of abstraction
6. UNIX-like OSes - everything is a byte stream -> COOL, I just like to search around for that config file -> COOL

More realistic alternatives:
1. lambdacd
2. Datomic, object-oriented dbs (Statice)
3. Hypercard on the Internet
4. Software dictates HW, not the other way around
5. Let's not be syntax freaks. Code is data, simplify syntax.
6. Object-oriented OSes (Genera)
