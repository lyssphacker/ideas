Protocols are in the context of OOP mentioned in:
1. [Object-Oriented Programming in COMMON LISP: A Programmer's Guide to CLOS](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-COMMON-LISP-Programmers/dp/0201175894)  
2. [Scott McKay at Dynamic Languages Wizards Panel (runtime topic)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbtEnfm7_Q)  
3. [The Art of the Metaobject Protocol](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1511408030&sr=1-1&keywords=metaobject+protocol)

Hinting at protocols?:
1. Alan Kay at OOPSLA 1997: I think our confusion with objects is the problem that in our Western culture, we have a language that has very hard nouns and verbs in it. Our process words stink. It's much easier for us when we think of an object—and I have apologized profusely over the last twenty years for making up the term object-oriented, because as soon as it started to be misapplied, I realized that I should have used a much more process-oriented term for it.—The Japanese have an interesting word, which is called ma. Spelled in English, just ma. Ma is the stuff in-between what we call objects. It's the stuff we don't see, because we're focused on the nounness of things rather than the processness of things. Japanese has a more process-feel oriented way of looking at how things relate to each other. You can always tell that by looking at the size of [the] word it takes to express something that is important. Ma is very short. We have to use words like interstitial or worse to approximate what the Japanese are talking about.  

Questions:
1. Are Java interfaces equivalent to protocols in Smalltalk? (some [hints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(object-oriented_programming))
2. Alan Kay talks about "real OOP" which is not what Java and similar languages provide. Is he partly thinking about protocol-oriented programming?
