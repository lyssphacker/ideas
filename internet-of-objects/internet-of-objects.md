#### CORBA vs SOA
Are CORBA and SOA could better be named distributed object-oriented programming?

#### Is RPC bad?
Is it worth revisiting CORBA?  
http://archive.oreilly.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/15469  

Was CORBA done with message passing or messaging in mind?

#### Peer-to-peer vs client-server
Is SOA peer-to-peer architecture?

#### SOA vs microservices
What is SOA all about?
How is microservices architecture related to SOA?

#### From ARPA/PARC community
1. [The LOCUS Distributed System Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-System-Architecture-Computer-Systems/dp/0262161028/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1514807872&sr=8-4&keywords=locus+system)  
2. [NAMING AND SYNCHRONIZATION IN A DECENTRALIZED COMPUTER SYSTEM](http://publications.csail.mit.edu/lcs/specpub.php?id=773)  
3. Alan Kay: "Part of the idea behind “real objects” was to act as “virtual machines” connected by “neutral messages” in the very same way as we were starting to design the Internet — and that the “virtual internet of objects” would map into the subsequent hardware network."  
4. [The Early History of Smalltalk](http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/): "In computer terms, Smalltalk is a recursion on the notion of computer itself. Instead of dividing "computer stuff" into things each less strong than the whole—like data structures, procedures, and functions which are the usual paraphernalia of programming languages—each Smalltalk object is a recursion on the entire possibilities of the computer. Thus its semantics are a bit like having thousands and thousands of computers all hooked together by a very fast network."  

#### Why microservices?
What is the major motivation for microservices?  
How are microservices related to earlier technologies, starting with CORBA, JavaBeans, etc.?  
[have we come full circle with microservices, back to very old school approaches?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/275927/have-we-come-full-circle-with-microservices-back-to-very-old-school-approaches)

#### Actors
[Akka Actors](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html)  
[What is the difference between Alan Kay's definition of OOP and Carl Hewitt's Actor Model?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Alan-Kays-definition-of-OOP-and-Carl-Hewitts-Actor-Model)  
[Alan Kay](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-successes-of-the-AI-group-at-Xerox-PARC-during-the-70s-and-first-half-of-the-80s-How-much-influence-did-it-have-on-other-groups-like-Smalltalk-group-and-vice-versa/answer/Alan-Kay-11): "This was my initial plan for Smalltalk. Fate intervened with something else. But these ideas reflected back to Carl Hewitt in his later “Actor” ideas, which are more like the early Smalltalk ideas, and which went beyond in a number of ways."  
[Alan Kay](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/09/11/moti-asks-objects-never-well-hardly-ever/):  
We didn’t even do all of the idea at PARC. Many of Carl Hewitt’s Actors ideas which got sparked by the original Smalltalk were more in the spirit of OOP than the subsequent Smalltalks. Significant parts of Erlang are more like a real OOP language the the current Smalltalk, and certainly the C based languages that have been painted with “OOP paint”.
