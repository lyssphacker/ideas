### Real object-oriented programming

What are differences between "real OOP" (as Alan Kay calls it) and conventional OOP?

How original inventors of Smalltalk and OOP were thinking about what they were doing can be best understood from the following resources:
1. [Seminar on Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjJaFG63Hlo)
2. [Design Principles Behind Smalltalk](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html)
3. [What is Alan Kay's definition of Object Oriented?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Alan-Kays-definition-of-Object-Oriented)
4. [From Squeak mailing list](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html)
5. Definition from Alan Kay: "OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other systems in which this is possible, but I'm not aware of them."
