### Real object-oriented programming

What are differences between "real OOP" (as Alan Kay calls it) and conventional OOP?

How original inventors of Smalltalk and OOP were thinking about what they were doing can be best understood from the following resources:
1. [Seminar on Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjJaFG63Hlo)
2. [Design Principles Behind Smalltalk](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html)
3. [What is Alan Kay's definition of Object Oriented?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Alan-Kays-definition-of-Object-Oriented)
4. [From Squeak mailing list](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html)
5. Definition from Alan Kay: "OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other systems in which this is possible, but I'm not aware of them."

[Do you consider the micro services movement as a realization of the real object oriented language as envisioned by Alan Kay, where the services would be the objects and the API calls would be the messages?](https://www.quora.com/Do-you-consider-the-micro-services-movement-as-a-realization-of-the-real-object-oriented-language-as-envisioned-by-Alan-Kay-where-the-services-would-be-the-objects-and-the-API-calls-would-be-the-messages)

8.2. [NAMING AND SYNCHRONIZATION IN A DECENTRALIZED COMPUTER SYSTEM](http://publications.csail.mit.edu/lcs/specpub.php?id=773)
8.3. Alan Kay: "Part of the idea behind “real objects” was to act as “virtual machines” connected by “neutral messages” in the very same way as we were starting to design the Internet — and that the “virtual internet of objects” would map into the subsequent hardware network."
8.4. [The Early History of Smalltalk](http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/): "In computer terms, Smalltalk is a recursion on the notion of computer itself. Instead of dividing "computer stuff" into things each less strong than the whole—like data structures, procedures, and functions which are the usual paraphernalia of programming languages—each Smalltalk object is a recursion on the entire possibilities of the computer. Thus its semantics are a bit like having thousands and thousands of computers all hooked together by a very fast network."
