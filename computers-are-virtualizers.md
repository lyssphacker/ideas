[Alan Kay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp9VbtLn2Jw&t=32m40s): "You can almost always make something that scales very very well by completely virtualizing the computer you have into some new kind of computer that's kind of."  

If one can take LOC of measure as a kind of metric for scalability, then it is useful to take a look at an example of Genera, the programming environment on Lisp Machines, which was implemented with roughly 1 million LOC, but provides comparable experience as any modern operating system (Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac) whose LOC go over several hunders LOC.  

What enabled the concise implementation of Genera?  

Were Genera designers able to virtualize the underlying machine into something very different? it is clear that Genera conceptually looks quite a it different than a Unix machines back then (what about now?).
