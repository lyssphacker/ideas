What we need is better systems. Systems are really hard to understand. Every little incremental improvement we should get out there, in the hopes that we can start getting ahead of systemitis that we have right now. I think this an enormous problem. The people who are good at it are not very good at it. I and my group think we are very good at it, but we also realize we are terrible at it. It is just **HARD**. It is really hard designing things that are more complex than a certain threshold. Once you get into that range, you really want the system to stay up, even it was badly designed. There are all these things you need ... If you just going around keeping the plates on the sticks, you are never going to learn anything. You have to have something that will keep the plates going on the stick so you can just stand back while they are going, and say ... those sticks suck. But if you are running around, or "I need better plates", or "I need motor on the stick", or something ... but if all you do is running around, you are just the slave of the system, rather than the other way.

... thinking that you are smarter than you actually are. Maybe everybody are super-duper smart, but the fact is that ... after you have written something, and suddenly forced to come back to it a year later ... even if you were that smart at the time, you are not now. Maybe there is just a big pitfall that this is just hard stuff, and not realizing that it is really hard is a huge mistake.
