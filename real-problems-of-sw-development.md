1. Software which is easily extendible for the purposes the designer did not intend
2. Integration of existing software systems
3. Extending existing sw should be easy, but it is actually hard. Design and architecture should be hard, but is super-hard, so hard that nobody is even considering doing it.  

Ad 1)  
Incremental changes should require only incremental extensions. Meta changes should require meta extensions. Both should be possible.

Ad 2)  
Why to write the same software over and over again? How to make disparate software bundles talk to each other?
