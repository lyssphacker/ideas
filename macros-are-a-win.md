#### Macros are a win

Scott McKay at [Dynamic Languages Panel (on runtime)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbtEnfm7_Q): Syntactic abstraction is the key to reducing the complexity of code, and nobody has caught on to hygenic macros. It is time for that to change. It super important. I cannot say anything about the implementation technology that I am using at my company or someone will shoot me. I have some apples to apples comparison showing an expansion of code of 24x for the same code between some other language and Java. My worst case nightmare scenario was an explosion of 10x, so I was not even close. And it is all due to the syntactic abstraction that this other language provides.

Will Clinger at [Dynamic Languages Panel (on compilation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbEMFMioLto): I found easier to list bad ideas that haven't been dropped, but whose time has nonetheless passed. Finalizers, for instance. On Sunday night a friend was telling me that C++ was much better than Java for his application becaues he could not predict when the Java finalizer would run. I asked him, why don't you just call pseudo destructor method explicitly whenever the relevant object goes out of scope. He said, it is hairy in the presence of exceptions and some programmers are bound to get it wrong or not do it at all. Ok, why not to make it impossible to create these objects except by using a macro that generates finalization code automatically. He said, Java does not have macros. He had a point. I think programming language designers have been avoiding macros becaue they hate C macros. Well, C macros ought to be hated, but designers have drawn wrong conclusions from their badness. As bad as they are, programmers use them. Why? Because they serve a purpose. Language designers should not be so arrogant as to think that their language is so much better than C that no project will ever need syntactic abstraction that designer failed to anticipate. Hygenic macros are a major win.
